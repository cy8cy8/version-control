# Git

Reference --> The Git Book

## Introduction

- **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** --> no single point of failure.
- **Stores data as snapshots of the project over time** --> a stream of snapshots.
  - Every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git takes a snapshot of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
  - If files have not changed, Git doesn't store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored
- Nearly every operation is local --> if you're offline or off VPN you can still work and commit (to your local copy).
- **Integrity maintained** --> everything in Git is checksummed (SHA-1 hash) before it is stored and is then referred by that checksum. 
  - Git stores everything in its DB not by file name but by the hash value of its contents.
- **Generally only adds data** --> Can experiment without the danger of severely messing things up.

## The 3 states

### Modified

- You have changed the file but have not committed to your DB yet.

### Staged

- You have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.

### Committed

- The data is safely stored in your local DB.

## The 3 main sections of a Git project

![The 3 main sections of a git project](./Images/ThreeMainSectionsOfGit.png)

### Working tree/directory

- A single checkout of 1 version of the project (files pulled out of the compressed DB in the Git directory and placed on disk to use or modify).

### Staging area

- A file (generally contained in your Git directory) that stores info about what will go into your next commit. 
- Also called the "index".

### The Git directory

- Where Git stores the metadata and object DB for your project.
- What is copied when you clone a repo from another computer.

## The basic Git workflow

1. Modify files in your working tree/directory.
2. Selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds only those changes to the staging area.
3. Do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.

- If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, itâ€™s considered committed. 
- If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. 
- If it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.

## Git Configurations

- System config `[path]/etc/gitconfig`.
- Global config `~/.gitconfig` or `~/.config/git/config`.
- Local config `config` file in the Git directory (`.git/config`).
- `--system` (values applied to every user on the system and all their repos) < `--global` (values specifically for 1 user) < `--local` (default)
- `git config --list --show-origin` to view all settings and where they are coming from, or simply `git config --list`
- `git config <key>` to check the value of a specific key such as `user.name`
- `git config --show-origin rerere.autoUpdate` to check which config file had the final say in setting a particular value (if you get unexpected value).
- After installing Git, set your username and email address immediately (every Git commit uses this info)
  - `git config --global user.name "<name>"`
  - `git config --global user.email "<email>"`
  - `git config --global core.editor <editor>` (must specify full path on Windows to its executable file)
  - If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, run the above commands without `--global` when you're in that project.

## Git Basics

- `git help <verb>` or `git <verb> --help` or `man git-<verb>` or `git <verb> -h` (simple) to get help.

### Initialising a repo in an existing directory or cloning from an existing repo

1. Go into the working directory.
2. `git init`
3. To start tracking: `git add <files>`, then `git commit -m "initial commit"`.

Otherwise, `git clone <url> (name)`

### Recording changes to the repo

- After setting up the bona fide Git repo and a checkout/working copy of its files, record changes when fit to do so.
- **Tracked files** --> Files that were in the last snapshot, as well as any newly staged files that can be unmodified, modified or staged.
- **Untracked files** --> Any files in my working directory that were not in my last snapshot + not in my staging area.
- Clean working directory: no modification from tracked files, no untracked files.

![Lifecycle of the status of my files](./Images/LifecycleOfFileStatus.png)

- `git status` or `git status -s` (short) to check the state of my files.
  - `??` --> new files that aren't tracked.
  - `A` --> new files that have been added to the staging area.
  - `M` --> modified files.
- **`git add <file>`** to begin tracking a new file/directory. Also used to stage files and do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved.
  - "Add precisely this content to the next commit"

### `.gitignore`

- Blank lines or lines starting with `#` are ignored.
- Standard glob patterns (simplified regex that shells use) work, and will be applied recursively throughout the entire working tree.
  - `*` matches 0+ characters.
  - `[abc]` matches any char inside the brackets e.g., a, b, or c.
  - `?` matches a single char.
  - `[0-9]` matches any char between them e.g., 0-9.
  - `a/**/z` would match nested directories e.g., a/z, a/b/z, a/b/c/z etc.
  - Start patterns with a forward slash `/` to avoid recursivity. End patterns with a forward slash `/` to specify a directory.
  - Negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point `!`.
- It's possible to have multiple `.gitignore` files of which apply only to the files under the directory where they are located.

```bash
# ignore all .a files
*.a

# but do track lib.a, even though you're ignoring .a files above
!lib.a

# only ignore the TODO file in the current directory, not subdir/TODO
/TODO

# ignore all files in any directory named build
build/

# ignore doc/notes.txt, but not doc/server/arch.txt
doc/*.txt

# ignore all .pdf files in the doc/ directory and any of its subdirectories
doc/**/*.pdf
```

### `git diff`

- `git diff` --> What have you changed but not yet staged? If you've staged all of your changes, this won't return an output.
- `git diff --staged` --> Compares your staged changes to your last commit.
  - Or `git diff --cached`

### `git commit`

- `git commit -v` to put diffs of files in as part of the commit msg.
- `-m` for inline msg.
- `-a` to skip the staging area and makes Git stage every file that is already tracked before doing the the commit, skipping `git add`.
